    "description": "Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania-type game developed by an indie studio named Team Cherry.\r\n\r\nMost of the game's story is told through the in-world items, tablets, and thoughts of other characters. Many plot aspects are told to the player indirectly or through the secret areas that provide a bit of lore in addition to an upgrade. At the beginning of the game, the player visits a town of Dirtmouth. A town built above the ruins of Hallownest. The players descend down into the ruins to find some answers to his questions.\r\n\r\nThe game revolves mainly around the exploration of the in-game world, which requires the players to have some platforming skills. The players have to find secrets that are scattered around the level and battle their enemies. There is a certain degree of backtracking in the game as some areas are locked until the player defeats a certain boss or picks up a specific item. Each area changes as the plot advances so it may be surprising to come back in a certain area. \r\n\r\nThe Protagonist uses a nail which serves as a replacement for a sword. Players can attack in four directions. The nail is upgradable.",

In the world of the game, there are developed cybernetic augmentations that enhance people's strength, agility, and memory. The city is governed by corporations. Many jobs are taken over by the robots, leaving a lot of people poor and homeless. Night City has a roaring underworld, with black markets, underground surgeons, drug dealers, and street gangs abound.\r\n\r\n###Characters\r\nThe main protagonist is fully customizable, including his or her sex and appearance, and goes by the nickname V. He or she is an underground mercenary who does “dirty business” for the various contractors. An NPC companion named Jackie joins the protagonist early at the game, and various other companions may join the player on certain missions as the plot demands. However, the game has no parties and no companion system.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe player controls V from the first person view, with the third-person view used for cutscenes only. The protagonist can travel across the city on feet or using various vehicles, in a manner some observers compared to GTA series. There are many options for the character customization, including three character classes, and a variety of augmentations V can install to enhance his or her abilities.",

For example, you can decide whether there will be a river nearby for fishing.\nThe farm area needs to be cleared, and it will take time.\nThe hero has many different activities: plant and care for plants, raise livestock, practice crafts, extract ore, and also enter into relationships with residents of the neighbouring town to earn game money. Relationships with characters include communication, performing tasks for money, exchanging, searching for fossils and even military actions and marrying. The character is limited by the reserve of strength and health - both parameters are visible on the screen, and the game automatically puts the hero to rest if the limit of his capabilities is close.

    "description": "The Last of Us Part II is the sequel to the post-apocalyptic zombie game The Last of Us.\n\nPlot\n\nThe game follows Ellie, the girl who was the secondary protagonist and the player character's companion in The Last of Us. The game is set five years after the ending of the original. Both Ellie (who is by 19 now) and Joel survived and live in Jackson, Wyoming, where Ellie is dating another girl, Dina. However, the characters have to deal with the evil cult called the Seraphites, who try to sacrifice their former members. A matter of revenge forces Ellie and her friends to undertake a trip to Seattle, Washington, to kill their enemies. The major theme of the plot is Ellie's dealing with her hate issues.\n\nGameplay\n\nUnlike in the original game, the player controls Ellie instead of Joel, who now becomes her AI-controlled companion. The game features improved controls that include new options such as crawling, dodging, and a jump button. A new AI system allows the human adversaries to communicate share information with each other. The game also introduces multiplayer.",

The main protagonist is a member of a shinobi clan. A samurai from the rival Ashina clan captured the protagonist's master, and the protagonist himself lost his arm trying to protect his leader. However, a sculptor of Buddha statues managed to replace the lost limb with an advanced prosthetic arm. The protagonist accepted a new name, Sekiro, meaning “one-armed wolf”. Now his goal is to avenge his clan and to save his leader from the hands of their enemies.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls Sekiro from the third person view and navigates the character as he fights multiple enemies. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice features an innovative combat system that doesn't use hit points. Instead, the opponents can be killed with a single precision strike. However, the player has to fight his or her way through the opponent's blocks and parries to land the deadly blow. The main character fights with his sword (katana) in the right hand, while his left hand can host a variety of upgrades, such as an ax, a torch, or a shield. The game also emphasizes stealth action. The player has to use a grappling hook to access multiple locations. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has no multiplayer.",

    "description": "Marvel's Spider-Man offers the player to take on the role of the most famous Marvel superhero.\r\n\r\n###Plot\r\nThe game introduces Spider-Man as an already experienced superhero. By the time the game begins, Peter has captured the infamous Kingpin as well as several other supervillains. Now, a gang that goes by the name of Demons poses a new danger to New York. Meanwhile, Peter is working for the scientist Otto Octavius, who didn't yet become Dr. Octopus, on their science project. Throughout the game, Spidey has to deal with multiple enemies, such as Norman Osbourne, Electro, Vulture, Rhino and Kingpin, among others.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe player controls Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, from the third person view. There are also sections of the game in which the player controls other protagonists, namely Mary Jane and Miles Morales. The game is set in a 3D environment that is modeled after New York City. The player can travel the city using web slings, running, jumping, and crawling the walls. The setting includes numerous high-rise buildings designed specifically for Spider-Man's movements.\r\n\r\nAs the player progresses, he or she unlocks new suits that grant Spider-Man new abilities, such as additional attacks or enhanced Spider-Sense. The abilities are not tied to the suits, however, and the player can use the suit of his or her choice without losing the ability. The combat system is similar to that in Batman: Arkham, in that Spider-Man fights many opponents in hand-to-hand combat but avoids killing them.",

Seven greatest mages sealed the monsters underground and left one entrance through a hole in the Ebott mountain. A lot of time passed since the war, but a human child accidentally falls down the mountain. Its goal is to get back out.\n\nUndertale uses pixelated graphics and traditional mechanics of RPGs such as earning experience points, having an open world, and so on. As the game goes on, the player has to solve several puzzles and interact with NPCs. The battles in the game are represented using the bullet hell mini-games with the player having an option to choose where they want to spare their opponent or hit the enemy back. Monsters behavior depends on the player's actions: if one decides to use a peaceful approach it will be easier to dodge the enemies attacks and vice versa. \n\nThe game features a branching story and several endings. The ending the player gets depends on whether they spared or killed the monsters they encountered throughout the game.",

You traveled from the Old World to study and hunt the dragons and other local monsters.  \r\nThe hunter, accompanied by an assistant, starts at the city of Astera, from where they can freely wander the open world. There are six regions in the New World, each with its own base camp. The camps are where you have to thoroughly prepare before every expedition, gathering equipment and provision. Before you can fight monsters, they need to be tracked down using Scout flies and studied to discover their habits, strengths, and weaknesses. There are no character levels, so your hunter’s effectiveness relies on the hunting gear you have equipped. Advanced armor and weapons can be created using a detailed crating system. Many items that you found on missions, including body parts of monsters, can be used for crafting.",

    "description": "###The Legacy\nOverwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter from the company that gave players the saga of Azeroth, Starcraft and the Diablo universe. Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.\n\n###The story and setting\nAnyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.\n\n###Continuous support\nThe game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.",

It is composed of small 3D cubes that represent specific types of materials or terrain. The gameplay is centered on mining and building various structures of your choice. You can also craft items like tools, weapons, and armor. There's an option to shift to the first or the third person view.\nMinecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.\nMinecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, became an iconic part of the popular culture. There are many myths and fan fiction surrounding the game, such as the legend of Herobrine, a rumored character that officially doesn’t exist.",

She works with the Federal Bureau of Control, a secret governmental organization that deals with the paranormal phenomena, often by annihilating it as a threat. The Bureau headquarters, known as the Oldest House, is taken over by a supernatural power called the Hiss. The director of Bureau, Zachariah Trench, is killed, and Faden is unexpectedly promoted to his place, while the ghost of her predecessor haunts her. She has to travel the endless corridors of the Oldest House and defeat the Hiss using magical Director's Pistol. \r\n\r\n###Setting\r\nMost of the game takes place in the FBC building, which is a high-rise on Manhattan. The Oldest House is a non-euclidian space, which is larger on the inside. Its corridors and rooms change shape and positions depending on the rituals its inhabitants perform. The Oldest House stores the magical artifacts called Altered Items.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe player controls Faden from the third person view. To defeat her enemies, she uses various superhuman powers, such as telekinesis or levitation. She also wields the shape-shifting Director's Pistol and the magic artifacts she can obtain as a reward for completing quests. Jesse's skills grow throughout the game. \r\n\r\nThere is no multiplayer mode.",

In the course of the travel, the protagonist also comes across a siren-like creature, who gives him gear for breathing underwater. The death occurs in several ways ranging from drowning to being shot with a tranquilizer dart. In addition to the basic ending, the storyline features an alternate one, which unlocks after collecting all the hidden glowing orbs.",

Hostile environments and one-hit deaths may seem difficult, but the game implements a fair amount of checkpoints. The monochrome color palette showcases cartoony proportions of every living thing while making lack of details threatening. Limbo shows you exactly what you encounter, but never how it looks.\n\nLimbo uses the atmosphere and sound design of the horror genre while avoiding tropes of the modern horror games. The overarching theme and unique style compensated for the rather short game with an abrupt ending, making Limbo one of the most impactful games for the genre.\n\nThe simple controls and easy-to-pick-up mechanics help to make a clear distinction, which part of the stage players can interact with, and which part can lead to the quick death. Even though the game is in black and white, this separation is intuitive and natural, so the player would know exactly where to go or what to do.",

    "description": "Dead Cells is a roguelike adventure title developed by Motion Twin.\n\n###Story\nNot much story is present in the game, as only bits of any information are given out to the players. The game takes place at a remote island, where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak, yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner's body, and gets back to the game's starting area. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game's heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.\n\nDead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.\n\nThe players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. \n\nThe game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can't take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves.",

For a more immersive experience, there are no random encounters or transitions to separate battlefields, and no grinding. Both navigation and combat happen in the same environment.\r\nUnshackled traversal -  Swim, climb, vault, jump off or hoist up ledges as you run through the world with a navigation system based on platformer expertise that breaks free from the classic bound-to-the-grid tileset movement.\r\nPrequel story set in The Messenger’s universe - Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you’d expect from a Sabotage production.\r\nFull-on dynamic lighting - Our custom-made render pipeline allows the creation of a breathtaking world coming to life by pushing the limits of 2D pixel-art games.\r\nThe Sabotage treatment on the turn-based RPG genre - Every system has been deeply analyzed to create an experience that pays respect to retro classics, while reworking some elements to offer a modernized experience free of irritants and timesinks.",

    "description": "In 1802, the merchant ship \"Obra Dinn\" set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.  \r\n \r\nEarly this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port with sails damaged and no visible crew. As insurance adjustor for the East India Company's London Office, find means to board the ship and recover the Crew Muster Roll book for assessment.\r\n\r\n(\"Obra\" is pronounced like \"Cobra\" without the C).\r\n\r\nFrom the author:\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n\r\nI want to challenge myself so this'll be a very different game from anything I've done before, including Papers Please. There'll be less creativity with the gameplay and instead I want to experiment with the rendering, story, and a few technical features. Right now I have only a rough idea about the narrative. I'm hoping to capture a compelling mystery with suspense and twists in the limited space of an old merchant sailing ship. It won't be the typical \"collect items and look for clues\" structure. There's a slightly cool gameplay hook but I won't go into details on that until much later.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevlog\r\n\r\nI'll try to keep this (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0) devlog lively as I make progress. Because the gameplay itself is more standard, there probably won't be as many creative updates as the Papers Please devlog. I will post lots of pictures and builds as soon as I'm able. Things will likely also move slower than Papers Please did too, at least at the start. P,P still takes a good amount of my time so there's less chance for me to maintain a laser-like focus on one project like last time. The lower bound for finishing this game is around 3 months but realistically I think it'll take me around half a year. My Maya skills are pretty rusty so I expect the modeling/animation to take the most time.\r\n\r\n\r\n1-bit Rendering\r\n\r\nMy first computer was a Mac Plus. I've always had a nostalgia-softened spot in my heart for 1-bit graphics. I'd like to capture the detailed black & white look of old Mac games in a realtime 1st person game. I plan to push it grittier and less cartoon-like than those old games; the hard part will be keeping everything legible without it becoming an unreadable mess of dithered pixels. One interesting problem with 1-bit rendering is that it doesn't scale well for images and it compresses to video like shit - so YouTube stuff may look really poor. We'll see how it goes.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnity 3D\r\n\r\nI'm gonna use Unity for this one. I fell in love with Haxe/OpenFL on my last project but unfortunately the 3D situation is not that great there yet. Also, it's time to finally see why 90% of the indie scene is using Unity. I have a good amount of experience with 3D games and the few days I've played around with Unity so far have been pretty productive. The animated title screen scene up there (with post-processing shaders and all) was created in one day. I now have unrealistically high hopes.",

In every level, the rules themselves are lying as blocks you can interact with; by manipulating them, you can change how the level works and cause surprising, unexpected interactions! With some simple block-pushing you can turn yourself into a rock, turn patches of grass into dangerously hot obstacles, and even change the goal you need to reach to something entirely different.\nThe game has over 100 levels that experiment with the game's mechanics in a multitude of ways, requiring the player to understand and manipulate the rules of the game and figure out devious ways to make the objects in the game world interact. The game will also feater a level editor for making your own levels and campaigns.\nThe game was originally created for & won the Nordic Game Jam 2017. The event had 142 entries in total. The game was made using Multimedia Fusion 2 by Clickteam.",

The game is focused on non-verbal communication that should make the player more attentive to the environment surrounding him. To complete the game, you need to solve puzzles in each of the eleven island's regions and get to the mountain in the center of it. While the regions differ a little, puzzles they feature are quite similar and, as a rule, have something to do with symmetry to be solved. Puzzles are activated at the grids you can find around locations. \nThere are two modes in the game. In the walking mode you can explore the island, and in the path-drawing mode you don’t move and focus on solving puzzles.\nWhile the game’s plot is quite unclear and The Witness doesn’t give many details on the hero’s background, its key feature is the visual aspect combined with music, inspiring quotes you can hear and the meditative tone of the game in general. The game features several visual illusions based on depth perception.",

    "description": "PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS is battle-royale shooter made only for the multiplayer experience. Players should do their best to become the last one alive. Matches are held on 3 main maps of a large size (Erangel, Miramar, and Sanhok). Each match has 100 participants fighting for themselves. The battle begins with players making the leap out of the plane to spread out across the map and to gather all possible equipment required for survival. Then, after a while, game intelligence randomly sets a circle shape safe zone, which gamers must reach to stay alive, and marks it on the map. Gear and resources are scattered throughout the map, so players can grab everything they need while running to the zone. Therefore, the main action comes out of the players’ collision on their ways to the circle. You can join the fight either alone or in a team (up to 4 people). Due to the customization system, lots of clothing items and weapon skins could be both bought on the marketplace and found in crates. However, in-app purchases don’t actually affect the gameplay.",

There are also PVE missions including dynamic historical campaigns and solo missions plus the custom events that add limitations or put certain victory conditions.\n\n### Changes\nBack in 2013 War Thunder featured 50 vehicles from the German and Russian trees of air forces and a small selection of maps to choose from. Over the course of the open beta and up to the original release in December 2016, the developers have added over 800 land and air vehicles spawning from British, Japanese, American and other vehicle trees, expanded the map selection, upgraded the interface and tweaked out the graphics and sound for better optimization.\n\n### Recent updates\nNow War Thunder also has naval battles and with the latest update added helicopters to the mix. All the while constantly maintaining the game’s balance, polishing the visuals and the impeccable sound design, fixing bugs and implementing new features.",

Without any knowledge who we are or what have we done, players must start to explore an aggressive and cruel fantasy world of criminals, bandits and murderers. Discover the mystery of a long forgotten the Eternal Empire, and survive.\n\nMechanics are pretty simple. Choose one of six different classes, gather gems for more skills to use and grind good and synergising equipment. Due to replaying, you can grind any needed equipment or resources to buy it from vendors. Infinite loop of gameplay will still be challenging. The cooperative mode allows beating the game with a party of friends up to six people at the same time.",

    "description": "Respawn into a new dinosaur survival experience beyond your wildest dreams… as ARK is reimagined from the ground-up into the next-generation of videogame technology with Unreal Engine 5! You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it!\nFEATURES\nARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically of off surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail.\nAdvanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall.\nARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island is released now, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis.\nThe definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond.\nThorough Quality of Life revamps in every area: redesigned User Interfaces, dynamic navigation for intelligent creature pathfinding, Wild Babies, Photo Mode, new Camera systems, new Map system, Tracking System, new Structures and Items, new Creatures, and much more.\nCross-Platform Modding: Download & play new custom content created by players, including new maps, creatures, items, and game modes, through a dedicated new Mod-bowser directly within the game! Enjoy an endless stream of new ARK content as the creativity and talent of the community is fully unleashed for the first time ever across gaming platforms!\nCross-Platform Multiplayer: form your online tribe across different gaming platforms as you work together to survive and thrive on the ARK!\nSupports public online multiplayer for up to 70 players, private-session multiplayer for up to 8 players, and local split-screen for 2 players.",

    "description": "This asymmetric multiplayer horror game in which one of the players tries on the role of a brutal killer, while the other four try to escape. Survivors play with a third person perspective, and the killer uses the first-person camera. The game has no singleplayer.\r\n\r\nPlayers can choose from 13 survivors and 12 killers. Each of them differs from each other with own upgrades system and special actions. There is no need to be polite and cooperative - every player for himself. Each level is procedurally generated, and each new round is offering a unique experience. The game engine selects from 10 presets,\r\n\r\nThe plot of the game tells a story about the supernatural being of The Entity, who created the world and populated it with serial killers. To save players have to perform a number of tasks, which include the repair of generators and other interactions with the items on the map. All actions with objects launch the so-called Skill Check - RNG that decides whether or not the action will be successful.",

With no plot or exact gameplay at all, anyone can create his own game mode to play for fun. You can find anything you're into. Trouble In Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Hunger Games, Franchise-based modes such as Star Wars or Lord of the Rings - anything.\n\nBasically, GMod stands for God Mode in video games, because you can play with any asset of the source engine. Try out physics, characters, maps, weaponry - anything. Based on that, Garry's Mod gives players quite a variety of mods to spend their time. It doesn't sound so earnestly. You will probably find something that will provide you with quite a good amount of fun. Servers are specifically sorted in game modes so you'll never play a different mode while playing exact one what you wanted. At the end of the day, this game is about receiving as much fun from what is happening around you as possible.",

Like in all previous Civilization games, the player controls one of eighteen unique historical civilizations, builds its cities, explores the hexagonal map of the world, researches technologies, develops his country's culture, establishes relationships with other civilizations and wages wars. All the traditional victory types are in place, and a new one, religious, is introduced.\n\nA distinct new feature in the sixth part is that city improvements are no more concentrated in each city's only main tile. Instead, they are distributed throughout its whole surrounding area. Each of them is now considered a \"district\" with a specific purpose, and some of them should be built only on specific terrain. Similarly, wonders now occupy tiles on their own. Technology tree was also modified to take into account the player's terrain improvements that may speed up the research of certain technologies. Cultural achievements, such as Opera or Drama, are no more considered \"technologies\" and form a separate Civics research tree instead. Also, unlike most of its predecessors, Civilization VI allows stacking similar types of military units.",

It means that the computer does not only act following the rules of the road but also takes some other techniques taken from real life, for example, gives a sign that passes the driver to the main road.\n\nThe time in the game is slightly different from the real time (1 minute in the set corresponds to five-ten seconds of real time). The driver can drive in total for 11 hours, after that he needs to go to the nearest Parking to make a nine-hour rest. If you do not, the driver gradually begins to struggle with sleep and yawn. The screen becomes dark, and the player, in turn, loses control of the truck, what can quickly lead to an accident.\n\nIn the game, there are temporary and permanent road signs that limit the speed mode. The maximum speed of all trucks in the game is technically limited to 90 km/h by default (but it can be disabled in the game settings).",
